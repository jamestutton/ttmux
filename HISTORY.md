# why

This script is still in alfa version, but this file can tell why I decided do
write it, instead of use other scripts. First of all, is was an opportunity to
learn bash scripting. Second, ... I needed a way to set up my tmux/vim
environment fastly that run always the same list of command to open always the
same list of windows with the same list of panes.
